My name is Tiago, I'm a Computer Engineer who graduated from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and a Data Scientist @ BTG Pactual.

I have experience working with data-driven solutions for retail companies, such as pricing, assortment, demand forecasting, and investment allocation. I also have experience with risk management for retail banking, such as credit risk, money laundering, and fraud detection.

My main side project is the scikit-net, a Python framework for machine learning tasks using complex networks. This also is the theme of my master's thesis where I use complex networks to do political analysis to improve our understanding of the Brazilian legislative system and also to make inferences about it.

I also have experience with machine learning solution productization and data product planning and execution.

I also am the developer of the EPCSAC, which is an online platform for researchers to compare Cloud Scheduling Algorithms. The EPCSAC started as my final project for my Computer Engineering degree, but I'm still improving the project and will keep doing so in the future. 

My main interests are:
- :bar_chart: Machine Learning, Data Science and Complex Networks
- :cloud: Cloud Computing
- :video_game: Emulation and Simulation
